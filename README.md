# Console Hangman

Play a classic game of hangman in the terminal. The program reads from a dictionary and will select a random word to be used in the game.

## Quick Start
Run consolehangman with the dictionary text file as the argument. In this case lexicon.txt, however you can use your own custom list of words.

```
python consolehangman.py lexicon.txt
```

## Usage

Normal hangman rules apply. You have a limited amount of wrong guesses before it is game over.
